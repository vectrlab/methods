# About this Book

This proto-textbook evolved from a collection of handouts used in my research methods course until 2020. I am making this available for former students who want to refer to these handouts but no longer have their original copies.

This book uses SPSS. I am preparing updated materials with more polished text and incorporating the use of R. 
As this book will not be updated further, I only recommend it to my former students who used it in their course.
